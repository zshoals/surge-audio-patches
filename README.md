This is a collection of synth patches I made for Surge, it's pretty much just here as a backup. They may be reliant on Wavetables that aren't provided here.

Do not expect consistent quality. Some sound surprisingly interesting, some are quite literally awful.

Use them if you want, but I'd appreciate it if you gave "Colorful" credit if you choose to use any of them. I am also not liable if these somehow break something on your end; use these at your own risk. 

Thanks.
